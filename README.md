# Summary

## Description
This package builds on top of the [DateTimeRange](https://pypi.org/project/DateTimeRange/) package to create a chronologically ordered sequence of datetimeranges called TimeLine. It contains methods to compute various operations on timelines including:  
- **merging** two timelines into one (union).  
- **splitting** a timeline based on a separating timestamp.  
- **intersection** of two timetines.  
- **difference** of two timelines.  
- **consume** a timedelta from a timeline.
